# Projects

### 1) Predictive Analysis of Rental Bike Demand (09/2024 - 11/2024)

This project focused on developing machine learning models to predict bike rental demand, leveraging two years of hourly and daily rental data along with weather and temporal factors. The analysis included data cleaning, feature engineering, and model building using techniques such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and time series models like ARIMA and SARIMAX. Key predictors, such as time of day, temperature, and humidity, were identified as significant factors influencing demand. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models delivered the best performance, effectively capturing demand patterns while highlighting areas for improvement during peak demand periods. The project’s insights support optimized fleet management, bike station allocation, and efficient resource planning for bike-sharing systems. Future work includes integrating external data like public events or advanced deep learning models for improved prediction accuracy and real-time forecasting.

### 2) Vehicle/Object Detection System (04/2024 - 06/2024)

This project developed a real-time system for vehicle and lane detection using a combination of computer vision techniques and machine learning. By integrating traditional image processing methods, such as Canny edge detection and Hough Transform, with deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Haar cascade classifiers, the system accurately identifies vehicles and lane boundaries in both video and still images. Key innovations include defining a region of interest (ROI) to enhance detection accuracy and optimizing a real-time pipeline for urban environments. The system demonstrated robust performance across diverse conditions, detecting and annotating vehicles and lane lines effectively. This project contributes to improved traffic management, road safety, and advances in intelligent transportation and autonomous driving systems.

### 3) Early Diabetes Detection Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques (01/2024 - 03/2024)

This project focuses on the early detection of diabetes using advanced machine learning techniques to address a critical global health issue. Utilizing the publicly available Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and enriched data sources, the study explored multiple models, including Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Decision Trees, AdaBoost, and Neural Networks, to predict diabetes with high accuracy. Extensive preprocessing, such as feature selection, handling class imbalances, and visualization, improved model interpretability and performance. The AdaBoost classifier emerged as the best-performing model with 97% accuracy and an AUC of 0.98. The results demonstrate the potential of machine learning to enhance early diabetes detection, reducing risks and complications. Future work will involve hyperparameter tuning, integration of deep learning methods, and optimization techniques to further improve predictive capabilities and contribute to personalized healthcare interventions.

### 4) Global Terrorism Data Analysis (09/2023 - 11/2023)
<p align="justify">
This project analyzes the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) to uncover trends in terrorist activities and their impact on global security. Using R and Tableau, the dataset, spanning 1970–2017 with over 180,000 incidents, was cleaned and explored to generate insights. Key findings include a significant rise in attacks since 2006, with the Middle East and North Africa being the most affected regions. Iraq recorded the highest number of attacks and casualties, and the Taliban emerged as one of the deadliest groups. Visualizations highlighted attack trends, success rates, regional variations, and human tolls, contributing to better-informed security strategies.
